Compiling Sass/Scss files to CSS files.

The browser can't use scss/sass files by itself.
Need to compile scss/sass to css.

=======================================

Assume the terminal is located at (scss).

1. Compiling individual files

    The compiled scss file will create a css output file at the 
    same directory level as the input file.

        sass input.scss output.css

2. Compiling input and output directories using folder paths.

    The compiler will create an output file at a differect directory
    withing the terminals current terminal's path location. If the 
    directory doesn't exist, it will create a new directory. The 
    output file path: scss/public/output.css

        sass ./input.scss:public/output.css

3. Compiling individual files with the --watch flag

    This flag tells Sass to watch your files for any changes and 
    re-compile them automatically.

        sass --watch input.scss output.css

4. Compiling input and output directories using folder paths with
   the --watch flag.

        sass --watch ./input.scss:public/output.css
